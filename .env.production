# Production Environment Variables for Hagenberg Game Jam Website
# Only variables that differ from defaults in config files are needed here

# Site URL (used by HydePHP) - Default in config/hyde.php is http://hagenberg-gamejam.at.test
SITE_URL=https://hagenberg-gamejam.at

# When games are served from R2, set the public bucket URL in the deployment
# environment (e.g. Cloudflare Pages env vars / GitHub Secrets), not here.
# Download links use {base}/games/{year}/{file}; build skips copying games when set.
# Example: GAMES_BASE_URL=https://files.hagenberg-gamejam.at

# All other values (GAMEJAM_WEBSITE, email, social links, etc.)
# already have correct defaults in config/gamejam.php
