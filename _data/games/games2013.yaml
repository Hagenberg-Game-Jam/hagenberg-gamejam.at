      Player one starts as the hunter and player two is the hunted. The hunter starts with a laser gun and his prey has bombs to defend himself. With your weapon you can push your opponent off the platforms and win the round. But be careful- the bombs' detonation radius hurts both of you. Also, the roles change each round. If a player leaves the screen, he automatically forfeits the round and his opponent gets a point.

      Start your vendetta and overwhelm your enemy!

    description: |-
      Two Mexicans are meeting in a bar. Suddenly one of them punches the other. The punched one starts to chase the puncher to get revenge. The chased one throws different obstacles (depending on the surroundings): chairs in the bar, barrels in the city, stones in the desert, as well as chilis.

      If the player gets hit by an obstacle, the chaser slows down. To catch the evil Mexican, the player can collect Tequila bottles, which provide the player with a short boost.

      Catch the evil Mexican and get revenge for being slapped!
