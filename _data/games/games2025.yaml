You sign a contract, stating that you will receive a massive bonus if you cause as much damage as possible to your current company. However, if you get fired before completing your fifth and final day at the company and receiving your paycheck, the offer is gone. During your workday, you must act artificially stupid and sabotage your objectives. Stay cautious; your boss is watching and will fire you if you are caught directly or if you overdo it.'

      Alone on a Planet, out in the Galaxy, Foggy. The game is about an expedition ship that has crashed on the planet Gamma Centauri. You are an android responsible for maintenance near the crash site, which is why the military contacts you and orders you to assist in the investigation of the crash, since the **stupid** AI of the research rovers that are supposed to handle the investigation keeps causing accidents. So you set out to repair the rovers and uncover the circumstances of the catastrophe. And try to return to your base safely.

      Head out, repair all the rovers, and return to the ship/main base. Try to survive as your battery slowly runs out while you're outside.

      Your boss has implemented a new AI system. He claims it can work 10 times faster and replace the least efficient employees. Only those who can keep up with the new bot will be allowed to stay.
      Rumors are spreading that the AI is secretly stealing work from certain employees to have them dismissed. You must act quickly and identify the AI to secure your job. However, be careful, you still have to complete your own tasks. If you fail to finish your work during the day, you will have to continue working at night.

      Banana Code is a "Werewolf" like game, where you have to find out who is an AI and who are your coworkers. It has a day-and-night cycle. Every night you are working on your Code and trying to get as many points as possible. During the day, the least efficient worker is fired, and in addition, you can vote out a player. But be careful: the AI gets more points and can steal half a player's points each night. The goal is to find the AI and vote it out before it can take your job.

      In this game, you take the role of a taxi driver tasked with picking up and transporting passengers safely and quickly to their desired destinations.

      Your constant companion is GPS-E (Global Positioning System - Eventually), a female AI navigation system designed to guide you through the city... with a little too much humor.

      Along the way, GPS-E provides directions with a sharp tongue, delivering sarcastic and unapologetically snarky commentary on the player's decisions. While her guidance is technically helpful, her attitude turns every journey into an entertaining and unpredictable experience.

      The player's goal is to drive passengers with a taxi to a desired building.

      Drop off as many passengers as possible at their desired destinations... before you end up in a coffin due to GPS-E's guidance.

    description: |-
      The player can purchase robots from a conveyor belt.

      When the player interacts with a robot, it begins to follow them.

      If a robot is following the player and they interact with an unoccupied task station, the bot is assigned to the station and begins working.
      If the player interacts with the now occupied task station again, the bot is removed.

      Occupied task stations generate money every second. There are 3 different types of task stations:

      1) Power stations (hamster wheels) generate the least revenue but also produce electricity. They do not consume any electricity.
      2) AI Art Stations (easel) generate slightly more money, but consume a little electricity.
      3) Crypto Mining Stations (computers) generate the most money (Hagencoin stocks are very high right now), but also consume a lot of electricity.

      Robots have a certain chance of becoming defective while working at a task station (recognizable by a smoke effect).
      The player can interact with defective robots to "repair" them...

      Players can buy new task stations at task plots by interacting with them. (Task plots cannot be purchased while a robot is following the player because we were too lazy to code the interaction system better.)

      Unnecessary robots can be "recycled" in an environmentally friendly way using the hydraulic press. (Please maintain the legally required safety distance when doing so!)

      The goal is to get rich and finally be able to afford RAM again. Have fun!

      Additional information (optional):

      Robots have the following stats, which are randomly assigned at purchase:
      1) Intelligence: Determines the efficiency of a robot when working at a crypto mining station.
      2) Creativity: Determines the efficiency of a robot when working at an AI art station.
      3) Robustness: Measures how long a robot can operate at a task station before it fails.

      Each stat can have a value between 1 (low) and 5 (high). The higher the value, the stronger the effect.

      A Little cat is trying to deliver her robots through a Portal. However, these robots are pretty dumb: they can only wander in one direction and stop after a short time. By rotating, you can help deliver all robots to the next level.

      After all robots have fallen off or been through the portal, you can go to the next Level through the portal as well.
