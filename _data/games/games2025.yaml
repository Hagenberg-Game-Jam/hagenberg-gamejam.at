      Finally, you've gained the confidence to ask out your online crush to a real-life meeting at her workplace, GF INC.

      But OH NO! In a tragic workplace accident involving numerous boxes of robot girl parts, your date falls apart-quite literally. Now it's up to you to put her back together and, hopefully, grow closer along the way.

      In this game, you take the role of a taxi driver tasked with picking up and transporting passengers safely and quickly to their desired destinations.

      Your constant companion is GPS-E (Global Positioning System - Eventually), a female AI navigation system designed to guide you through the city... with a little too much humor.

      Along the way, GPS-E provides directions with a sharp tongue, delivering sarcastic and unapologetically snarky commentary on the player's decisions. While her guidance is technically helpful, her attitude turns every journey into an entertaining and unpredictable experience.

      The player's goal is to drive passengers with a taxi to a desired building.

      Drop off as many passengers as possible at their desired destinations... before you end up in a coffin due to GPS-E's guidance.

      The player can purchase robots from a conveyor belt.

      When the player interacts with a robot, it begins to follow them.

      If a robot is following the player and they interact with an unoccupied task station, the bot is assigned to the station and begins working.
      If the player interacts with the now occupied task station again, the bot is removed.

      Occupied task stations generate money every second. There are 3 different types of task stations:

      1) Power stations (hamster wheels) generate the least revenue but also produce electricity. They do not consume any electricity.
      2) AI Art Stations (easel) generate slightly more money, but consume a little electricity.
      3) Crypto Mining Stations (computers) generate the most money (Hagencoin stocks are very high right now), but also consume a lot of electricity.

      Robots have a certain chance of becoming defective while working at a task station (recognizable by a smoke effect).
      The player can interact with defective robots to "repair" them...

      Players can buy new task stations at task plots by interacting with them. (Task plots cannot be purchased while a robot is following the player because we were too lazy to code the interaction system better.)

      Unnecessary robots can be "recycled" in an environmentally friendly way using the hydraulic press. (Please maintain the legally required safety distance when doing so!)

      The goal is to get rich and finally be able to afford RAM again. Have fun!

      Additional information (optional):

      Robots have the following stats, which are randomly assigned at purchase:
      1) Intelligence: Determines the efficiency of a robot when working at a crypto mining station.
      2) Creativity: Determines the efficiency of a robot when working at an AI art station.
      3) Robustness: Measures how long a robot can operate at a task station before it fails.

      Each stat can have a value between 1 (low) and 5 (high). The higher the value, the stronger the effect.
