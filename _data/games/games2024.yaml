    description: |
      Inspired by classic LucasArts point-and-click adventure games, Der Herr Lumpus follows a child who believes he is an adult. Imitating his perception of adult behavior, the story explores a day in his life as someone who thinks he is a tax consultant (Steuerberater) — or at least he thinks he is. The idea for Der Herr Lumpus originated from a pen-and-paper campaign we played, where Herr Lumpus became a standout character. His childlike mind and unique perspective on how children view the adult world made him the perfect protagonist for our game. The game is a short, pixel-art point-and-click adventure that captures the nostalgic charm of LucasArts titles like Monkey Island. Players interact using the left mouse button to look around, click on objects, and solve puzzles.

      In "Pasta from the Blasta," you play the role of an elderly woman. Your grandchildren try to put you into a retirement home, but you still have some fight left in you! Fight against them trying to reach you by feeding them your world-famous "sticky noodles" from your noodle maker gun. As the name implies, your noodles are also sticky enough to help you get across obstacles, which might, sadly, be too much for your old limbs to handle on their own.

      Oh no! You've been sucked through a time portal and find yourself in the prehistoric past! To make things worse, a giant volcano is erupting, and the explosion is hurling dinosaurs through the air! Before finding a way back to the future, you need to survive. Dodge the dinosaurs (and the panicking caveman) and collect as many shells as possible!
