      You have to survive! There are catastrophes (floods and asteroids) that you have to avoid. You can hide under buildings and jump onto platforms to rescue yourself.

      Some power-ups give you specific abilities (higher jumping, more speed, recovering life, and a shield that protects you against the asteroids)
      Some objects are lying around that you can jump on. Coins are spawning in the world that give you extra points. Collect them!

      Try to get the biggest high score!

      In keeping with the theme of GameJam2012, "It's the end of the world as we know it," what could be more fitting than the Mayan calendar... and all of this implemented in an action-packed way. Armed with a bamboo Gatling gun, you run through a small temple to shoot down a horde of living Mayan stone statues.

      There is only one minute left until December 21, 2012 (the end of the world), and all eight enemies must be eliminated within that minute.

      Features: Detailed 3D models, awesome lighting effects, tons of cool animations and sounds!!! Crazy gameplay!

  game:

    players: 1-2
    controls:
      - keyboard
    description: |-
      The aim is to protect the world from the meteor storm and either catapult the burning celestial bodies away or deposit them in the designated pit using a net stretched between the players.

      If the players manage to transport a meteorite into the pit, the score is increased accordingly.

      After the Earth has been hit three times, it is finally destroyed, the game ends, and the high score is displayed.

      The score is made up of survival time (in seconds) and collected meteorites (25 points each).

      Note: The game's download is an Adobe Flash SWF File. To play it on a modern-day system, use a Flash emulator like [Ruffle](https://ruffle.rs/).

      Try to destroy the falling asteroids to get points. Shoot at them to eliminate them. If you can't hit them, try to avoid them by moving left and right. If your vehicle gets a hit, it will explode... GAME OVER!

      Evade all obstacles on the ground, jump for your life. You can't destroy them with your gun.

      If you fall into a hole, your car will melt... GAME OVER!

      If you drive into a stone, your car will explode... GAME OVER!

      Don't drive off the screen; you will never survive with that strategy... GAME OVER!
