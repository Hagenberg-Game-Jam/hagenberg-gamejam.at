      Two hot-headed superhero trainees were fighting over a half-eaten taco using their superhuman strength. The League of Blub intervened and, in their unusual way of dealing with problems, decided to withdraw their superpowers and leave the two of them floating in space.

      They are now tied together with an energy band and left with nothing but their will to survive. Desperate to regain their former powers, they try to collect the might power orbs (yes, the League of Blub ironically left those too) and fight each other in a battle of epic proportions.

      But who will prevail, Blue or Red?

      You are the new leader of the League of Superheroes. You are in command of the laboratory and superhero operations worldwide.
      The goal is to defeat enough villains to stop Dr. Evil's pursuit of world domination.

      If you run out of time, funds, or superheroes, the game is lost. To defeat villains, you have to 'buy' new heroes and equip them with superpowers. Then you send them into combat. Villains are attacking cities around the world at random. Your map helps you keep track of them.
      The outcome of a fight is determined by the superpowers of both the hero and the villain.

      Which combinations are the most effective is for you to discover. The 'Justice News' newspaper helps you with this task.

      Note: The game's download is an Adobe Flash SWF File. To play it on a modern-day system, use a Flash emulator like [Ruffle](https://ruffle.rs/).

      The game is a classic beat 'em up for two players, but the abilities change randomly at regular intervals.
      The attacks available are a melee attack, a range attack, and a shield attack.

      From time to time, (too) small texts flash under the respective player info. While this display is flashing, you must press the corresponding button to trigger an "UBER POWER."
