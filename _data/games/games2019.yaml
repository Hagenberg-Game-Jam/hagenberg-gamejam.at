      You assume the role of a lone gunslinger who travels from ghost town to ghost town. Your mission: to build a bell tower just before midnight to ring in the witching hour.

      Collect building blocks, rotate and stack them on top of each other. You can only stand on top of not occupied blocks. Blocks underneath other blocks can't be picked up. To complete the tower, place the bell on the top. Use your gun to attack UFOs that try to steal your blocks.

      You are a vampire that was kidnapped by a blood cult. You awake, mortally wounded, in a cave surrounded by cultists. They want to sacrifice you to their dark god, you want to live. In compromise you slaughter them.

      But the only weapon you currently possess is your own blood. You lose blood, and come closer to death, with every second that passes and attacking your foes only weakens you further. But luckily you are a vampire and can restock your blood reserves by draining blood from fallen enemies.

      Now you have to fight your way out of the cults cozy home cave but beware of traps, pentagrams, and the fanatic followers of the EVIL CULT LEADER.

      Valhella is a top-down 2D game about a Viking that gets sent to hell instead of Valhalla and accidentally starts an uprising by convincing prisoners, breaking down doors and dancing with demons.

      The game consists of an overworld, where the player can move by using the WASD controls and the mouse for interaction, and three different minigames.

      Minigames:
      - Door knockdown: Hit any keys a certain amount of times, depending on difficulty, in a short timeframe (you can hit multiple keys at the same time)
      - Convincing: W/A for moving up and down through the ear canal. Don’t hit anything on your way to achieve a score of 10 and to convince the prisoner successfully
      - Dance Dance Demon Battle: Use the arrow keys to hit the shown arrow at the right time. Get through a short timeframe without making too many mistakes to win.
